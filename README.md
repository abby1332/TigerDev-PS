# Git Cheat Sheet <br />
IMPORTANT: Before editing any code, make sure you switch branches! <br />
For creating a new branch: `git checkout -b "branch name"` <br />
For checking out to an existing branch: `git checkout "branch name" <br />
After you finish coding, update your branch: <br />
`git add "file path"` or `git add .` (adds ALL unchanged files) <br />
`git commit -m "Commit message here"` <br />
`git push` <br />
If its your first time pushing: `git push --set-upstream-origin "branch name"` <br />
<br />
# Remember: <br />
Always pull when you switch to a new branch <br />
Update your branch regularly <br />
Never work on someone else's branch without telling them first <br />
Never edit the main branch <br />
Never merge your branch to main without permission <br />
