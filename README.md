# Git Cheat Sheet
IMPORTANT: Before editing any code, make sure you switch branches!
For creating a new branch: `git checkout -b "branch name"`
For checking out to an existing branch: `git checkout "branch name"
After you finish coding, update your branch:
`git add "file path"` or `git add .` (adds ALL unchanged files)
`git commit -m "Commit message here"`
`git push`
If its your first time pushing: `git push --set-upstream-origin "branch name"`

# Remember: 
Always pull when you switch to a new branch
Update your branch regularly
Never work on someone else's branch without telling them first
Never edit the main branch
Never merge your branch to main without permission
