Remove alpha channel from "res://Assets/Images/Backgrounds/forest_bright.png"

Get rid of "res://Assets/Misc/TenMillionPixels/ahmads_casual_last_minute_addition.png"

Make "res://resources/TileMaps/tile_grass.tscn" a TileSet instead of an entire scene.

Fix the music manager system (it's a global script but also a scene at the same time???)

Make a `Level` class_name that keeps info (song, name, spawn point) and handles respawning player.
